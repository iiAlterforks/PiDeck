# Changelog

[中文](CHANGELOG.zh-CN.md)

All notable changes to PiDeck are documented here.

## v0.6.7 - 2026-07-29

### 🚀 New Features

- **Compact titlebar + Codex-style right sidebar** — Slimmer top chrome and
  right-drawer tabs restyled for denser multi-panel workflows (Files / Git /
  Browser / ScratchPad).
- **File editor nested under Files tab** — Editor tabs live inside the Files
  drawer instead of a separate surface; drawer chrome is tighter and more
  consistent with Git/Browser panels.
- **File tree drag / drop / move** — Drag files into the tree, paste files, and
  drag-to-move entries inside the project file panel.
- **@ file suggestions with directory tree & search** — File picker shows a
  browsable tree plus filter, making deep paths easier to reference.
- **Composer file path refs via paste / drop** — Drop or paste files into the
  input to insert path chips; spaced paths are preserved correctly.
- **Text links open in built-in editor** — Clicking text-file links opens the
  in-app editor; binary files still open externally.
- **Batch Ask Tab UI** — `ask_question` batch mode renders all questions as tabs
  with an optional Submit/review step before returning answers.
- **Ctrl/Cmd+click markdown links open system browser** — Modifier-click leaves
  the in-app browser and hands the URL to the OS default browser.
- **Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn + sonner toasts** — Renderer styling stack upgraded;
  toast notifications migrate to `sonner` with theme-aware presentation.
- **Sidebar project expand/collapse persistence** — Project fold state is
  remembered across app restarts.
- **Session message Fork** — Fork a new session from a user message (pi `/fork`);
  hidden while the agent is busy; fills the original prompt into the composer
  for edit-and-resend.
- **Boot splash official pi assembly animation** — Cold-start overlay loops the
  same pixel tetromino logo animation as the sidebar (larger/faster); PiDeck
  title and subtitle use Plantin brand serif to match the empty-state tone.
- **Single-instance window reuse** — On by default: opening PiDeck again focuses
  the existing window (including tray-hidden) instead of spawning another
  process; can be disabled in Common settings (restart required).
- **Startup window size presets** — Appearance setting for maximized / fullscreen
  / large-medium-compact windows; default maximized (historical behavior that
  keeps the taskbar visible).
- **Compaction settings UI** — Config → Settings splits `compaction` into Auto
  compact / Reserve reply tokens / Keep recent tokens instead of raw JSON.
- **LaTeX / math fence rendering** — Session `latex`/`tex`/`math` code fences
  render with KaTeX.
- **Electron Chromium sandbox toggle** — Dev setting to enable renderer sandbox
  (off by default for Windows AV/GPU compatibility); requires app restart.

### ✨ UX Improvements

- **Plan mode flow polish** — End-of-plan three-card layout, revise back button,
  and clearer read-only skip behavior.
- **Composer widgets & extension UI** — Extension widgets stay above the
  composer, height is more compact, and built-in extension conflict handling is
  friendlier (including todo labels).
- **Context compact entry** — Composer compact control only shows when context
  usage is above 30%; calmer styling, and friendly toasts for session-too-small
  / nothing-to-compact errors.
- **UI color neutralization** — Reduce saturated green accents; refine composer
  bar and status indicator contrast.
- **Worktree sidebar hierarchy** — Clearer nesting, collapsible worktree
  sessions, lighter fills, and less visual noise on active rows.
- **Extension install / uninstall UX** — Clearer progress and reliable local file
  cleanup on uninstall.
- **RPC / agent launch options** — Optional `--no-themes` / `--offline` /
  `--no-extensions` / `--no-skills`, version cache warm-up on app start, and
  dev settings to disable extensions/skills for faster or safer launches.
- **Docs & community** — Docs-site screenshots updated to the latest UI; expanded
  English home and bilingual nav; README Star History chart auto-updates via CI;
  tutorial video production workflow added for maintainers.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Composer history ↑/↓ drops half-typed draft** — ArrowUp now snapshots the
  live draft from `livePromptByAgentRef` instead of a stale rendered prompt, so
  ArrowDown restores the full in-progress text.
- **Agent start crash-safety / diagnostics (esp. macOS arm)** — Attach pi process
  lifecycle listeners before `spawn`, keep a default `error` sink so ENOENT no
  longer becomes an uncaught main-process crash, surface structured startup
  failure cards, and log platform/arch + child-process-gone details for Issue
  triage. Also expand macOS pi search paths (`/opt/homebrew/bin`, etc.) for
  Dock-launched PATH gaps.
- **Pet stuck on review/failed/jumping** (#107) — Transition recovery timers are
  no longer cleared by cooldown/overlap early-returns, so review/failed return
  to idle on schedule.
- **Stop abort afterglow** — Seal stream generations on abort so delayed
  thinking/text no longer mix into the next reply; stop feedback is toast-only.
- **Disabled built-in extensions still loaded** — Remove/conflict yield now deletes
  user-dir built-in extension files and purges residuals so third-party tools no
  longer clash and break RPC.
- **Manual compact button & state** — Restore composer compact control; send
  `customInstructions` on RPC; clear `isCompacting` and return to idle after
  finish; surface concrete failure reasons in toasts.
- **System titlebar missing sidebar toggles** (#104) — Left/right sidebar
  switches remain available when using the OS native title bar.
- **Paste image as attachment + spaced path refs** — Image paste attaches as
  image content; file path chips keep spaces instead of breaking mid-path.
- **Terminal dock race / unhandled rejection** — Harden dock against pending
  agent transitions and avoid unhandled promise rejections on close/switch.
- **Terminal dock owner isolation** — Dock state is keyed by owner so project
  terminals no longer leak across agents/sessions.
- **Clipboard “Document is not focused”** — All copy paths go through Electron
  main-process `clipboard.writeText` via preload, with graceful fallbacks.
- **Local file links + todo widget fonts** (#103) — Local file links are
  clickable again; todo widgets honor the configured interface font.
- **Incomplete tool/thinking turns merge into next reply** — Thinking-only
  assistant turns are preserved; normal incomplete runs no longer get merged
  into the following answer.
- **Resend safety** — Resend only truncates descendants of the current user
  turn and refuses unsafe non-last-user roots.
- **Select cancel no longer picks first option** — Cancel returns `value: null`
  instead of a cancelled sentinel that could be misread as a selection.
- **Agent `get_state` timeout auto-retry** — Startup state fetch retries on
  timeout instead of leaving the agent stuck.
- **Composer placeholder & prompt history** — Clearing the input restores the
  placeholder; prompt history persists across restart.
- **Manual release with empty tag** — Workflow_dispatch without a tag publishes
  a formal release instead of a draft-only artifact.
- **macOS test build OOM** — CI mac build uses `build:fast` and a higher Node
  heap limit.
- **package-lock dependency sync** — Restore missing lockfile entries after
  merge/tooling drift.

## v0.6.6 - 2026-07-25

### 🚀 New Features

- **Sidebar brand lockup redesign** — The official pi canvas logo now uses a cropped
  bounding box (no empty board space), displays the PiDeck wordmark in Plantin serif,
  and animates on agent start/close events for visual feedback. The settled color is
  theme-adaptive (ink/white).
- **Multi-tab file editor** — Up to 5 concurrent editor tabs, modal/drawer dual mode,
  diff comparison mode, Monaco editor with dark/light themes, Markdown preview, and
  auto-save (Ctrl+S) with dirty state indicator.
- **Session reference (@-mention)** — Type `&` to pop up the session list for the
  current project, select specific messages or reference the full context. Selection
  persists across reopens.
- **Feishu/Lark integration** — Bi-directional messaging, streaming cards, auto-group
  creation, member management, and a dedicated Feishu link indicator in the composer.
- **Git source control (major rewrite)** — VS Code-style 3-tab panel (Changes / History /
  Compare), AI commit message generation, Git graph with colored lanes, cherry-pick /
  revert / reset / drop via context menu, branch switching, and worktree support.
- **Git Push / Pull** — Push and Pull buttons in the Changes pane header with full IPC
  pipeline and error notifications.
- **Customizable Commit Message Prompt** — New Setting `gitCommitMessagePrompt`,
  a textarea in the Git section, template supports `{diff}` placeholder, Gitmoji mapping.
- **Git panel relative paths** — Directory group headers now show paths relative to
  project root instead of absolute file system paths.
- **Chinese Prompt Store (XuePrompt)** — Replaced old yao-prompts files with SQLite
  database (~4000 Chinese prompts). Supports 20+ category filters, FTS3 full-text
  search, pagination, and one-click import.
- **Skills.sh Community Skill Store** — Switched to CLI registry
  (skill.xfyun.cn) for search, installing via `npx -g -s <skill> -y` with sort by
  downloads and installation animations.
- **HTML preview uses built-in browser** — Opening an HTML file defaults to source view.
  Clicking the preview button switches to the right-side browser panel with webview
  rendering, eliminating iframe sandbox restrictions.
- **Composer redesign (OpenCode style)** — Replaced the top pill-button toolbar with a
  bottom bar: mode toggle / prompt template / attachment / model name / thinking level.
- **Client message queue** — Queue messages while the agent is busy (follow-up or steer
  mode). Retract queued messages back to the editor. Visual queue status.
- **Recommended extension packages** — All packages show copy-install-command buttons,
  action buttons arranged horizontally, install status per-package.
- **Async skill installation** — `npx skills install` runs via `execFile` without
  blocking the main process UI.
- **Built-in browser panel** — Browse in the right drawer with tabs, fullscreen, and
  mobile viewport presets. Links open internally in the browser panel.
- **ScratchPad** — Overlay-style scratch pad with content preview, selection mapping,
  and theme-aware semantic colors.
- **Local packaging** — `npm run compile-exe` for fast portable `.exe`. `npm run dist:win`
  supports single-format builds (nsis / portable / zip).
- **Auto-scroll to latest message** on historical session open.
- **Toast notification system** — Self-built notice mechanism replaces `sonner` dependency.
  Agent operations, file copy, model switch, and Git actions all show notifications.
- **Expandable compaction card** — Pre-compaction message history visible in a
  collapsible section.
- **WSL environment support** (experimental) — Session scanning, file operations, and
  path handling adapted for WSL.
- **WSL environment support** — Session scanning, file operations, and path
  handling adapted for WSL (via @Lopution PR #84).

### 🔧 Terminal & UX

- **Terminal shell selector** — Detect available shells (pwsh, Windows PowerShell,
  cmd, Git Bash, WSL) on Windows. Dropdown menu next to the + button lets you pick
  which shell to open.
- **Project-level terminal** — Terminal is now tied to the project, not the agent.
  It stays open when switching agents or when no agent is running.

### ✨ UX Improvements

- **Settings redesigned** — Global draft save/cancel replaces per-tab save buttons.
  New tab categories: Common, Appearance, Proxy, Dev, Pet, Storage.
- **Font size/face per-zone** — Independent font size configuration for chat, code,
  sidebar, and composer. Preset themes (Sans/Serif/Mono) and window zoom.
- **File sidebar** — New create file/folder functionality, tree view for Git panel,
  relative paths, persistent drawer state per project.
- **Behavior selector moved left of stop button** — Clearer visual layout.
- **Composer bottom bar style unified** — All buttons use `composer-bar-btn` style
  (28px small radius).
- **Skills/Prompts auto-refresh on local tab switch** — Newly installed items
  immediately visible.
- **Document preview** — Markdown files default to rendered preview (with source
  toggle). HTML files preview in the built-in browser panel.
- **File diff side-by-side toggle** — Now works reliably in modal mode (key remount +
  keepCurrentModel). Button hidden in drawer mode (container too narrow for split view).
- **Built-in browser webview stability** — Fixed initial load cancellation (ERR_ABORTED),
  dom-ready infinite refresh, and webview-not-ready white screen issues.
- **Browser close/maximize buttons moved to tab bar** — Saves vertical space.
- **Copy install command button** — Added next to install buttons for manual terminal use.
- **Session outline & quick action bar** — Floating outline panel with jump-to-message.
  Quick actions: terminal, file drawer, Git, browser, scratch pad, external editor.
- **NoSession anonymous agent** — Chat entry at top of project list, writes to app
  user-data directory for general conversations.
- **Content width restriction** — Draggable content width slider for comfortable
  reading of long code lines.
- **Pin mode** — Pin frequently used agents to the top of the sidebar.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Monaco CSP error** — `loader.config({ monaco })` moved to module scope, preventing
  CDN fallback blocked by CSP.
- **TurnRow "Rendered fewer hooks" crash** — Moved `useMemo` before early returns,
  fixing white screen on sending messages.
- **"TextModel got disposed before DiffEditorWidget model got reset"** — Added
  `keepCurrentOriginalModel` + `keepCurrentModifiedModel` to prevent model disposal
  race when switching diff editors.
- **Stop button invisible during agent response** — Now always shown when agent is busy.
- **NoSession anonymous agent duplicate in sidebar** — Added `noSession` matching path.
- **Agent startup status stuck on "starting"** — Fixed `setAgents` to overwrite
  existing entries when API returns.
- **Same-session resend truncation** — Fixed to delete only the last message's
  descendant entries, not everything before it.
- **Skills.sh search crash** — Added `Array.isArray` guard in `loadPersisted()`.
- **Prompt category returns no data** — DB category matching fixed between slug
  and original name.
- **Title bar color mismatch** — Unified `background` across `.window-controls`.
- **sql.js ESM loading failure in packaged app** — Fixed WASM path resolution.
- **GitService.getStagedDiff maxBuffer too small** — Increased from 5KB to 10MB.
- **Dev terminal Chinese garbled** — Auto-run `chcp 65001` on Windows.
- **HTML preview white screen** — Fixed webview dom-ready infinite refresh and
  ERR_ABORTED on initial load.
- **Docs site build failure** — VitePress YAML `&` wrapped in quotes.
- **TypeScript CI failure** — Removed duplicate `setAttachedImages` function.
- **Bundled extension disabled/re-enable** — Fixed loss of built-in extensions after
  disable.
- **Old pi compatibility** — Graceful fallback for `--no-approve` parameter.
- **Session loading indicator flicker** — Enforce a 200 ms minimum display duration
  to avoid a brief flash on fast API responses.
- **Send message auto-scroll** — Scroll to end instead of beginning.
- **Thinking animation removed** — Unified "responding" animation as default.
- **Agent idle after agent_end** — Added fallback idle check to avoid stuck animation.
- **Multi-select image share padding** — Added padding to avoid text clipping.
- **Ask dialog interaction** — Confirm button sizing, custom input always visible,
  hide background card when dialog open, filter out Pi's default ✎ option.
- **Message CPA_DONE marker cleanup** — Strips `CPA_DONE` from message end.
- **User message edit** — Edited text backfilled to composer for re-sending.
- **Feishu link "Cannot find package @larksuiteoapi/node-sdk" after packaging** —
  The `afterPack` cleanup script was deleting the CJS build (`lib/`) assuming
  `await import()` would use the ESM entry, but the package has no `exports` field
  so Node.js resolves via `main` → `./lib/index.js`. Removed the deletion to fix
  runtime resolution.

### 🐛 Terminal Fixes

- **Terminal always opened pwsh.exe** — `spawnShell` computed the priority-sorted
  candidate list but was iterating over the original unsorted array, so the
  preferred shell was always ignored.
- **Shell dropdown clipped by overflow:hidden** — `.terminal-tabs` had
  `overflow: hidden` which clipped the absolutely-positioned shell menu above it.
- **Object destroyed crash on terminal data after window close** — The emit
  callback lacked a guard against destroyed `webContents`.
- **Stop button not cancelling on first click** — Added `recentlyAborted` set to
  discard delayed pi events after abort.
- **429 error not shown in chat** — Auto-retry failure now sets agent status to
  error and appends a visible error message.

  - Frontmatter stripping on send, `description` metadata attached to prompt RPC
  - Unicode naming support (Chinese, Japanese, etc.) for prompts and skills
- **Prompt/Skill Store Integration**
  - `prompts.chat` store: search, preview, and import prompts with variable-hint conversion
  - Yao Open Prompts: 121 bundled Chinese prompts across 9 categories with category filter, search, and preview
  - New Skill Store tab for searching prompts.chat skills
- **Git Worktree Workspace Management**
  - `WorktreeService`: detect git worktrees, create/delete via IPC

- **Thinking card visual refresh**: "思考" label, border removed, duration shown, chevron right after label, lighter hover
- **Tool cards**: borders and background tints removed to match thinking card style, tertiary text for details
- **Answer text**: font-size increased to 15px, line-height 1.68
- **Turn row gap**: increased from 8px to 12px between blocks

### 🔧 Performance

- **Session open optimization**: Parallel `get_state` + `get_messages` on agent start
- **loadMessages**: parallel `get_messages` + `get_entries` via Promise.all
- **Initial session load**: skip `get_entries` (defer to edit/delete)
- **IPC payload reduction**: strip `originalContent` from tool ChatMessage meta
- **History message counting**: by conversation turns (20 turns) instead of raw message count
- **Removed `repairAssistantUsage`**: importers already add usage fields, no need to check on every session open
- **loadMessages retry**: only on failure, not unconditionally
- **Cleaned up all `[perf]` debug logs and unused timing code**

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Windows crash fix**: globally disable Chromium sandbox (`--no-sandbox`), resolves `0x80000003` breakpoint crash on startup
- **Pi auto-compaction process restart**:
  - New tracking sets: `compactingAgents`, `userInitiatedStop`, `autoRestartAttempted`
  - Process exit handler: three-tier check (user-stop / compacting / clean restart)
  - `reattachProcess()`: preserves agentId + messages, replaces PiProcess + RPC client on restart
  - Manual compaction RPC failure → auto `reattachProcess()` (compaction already written to file)
  - Stop/stopAll marks user-initiated stop, skips auto-reconnect
- **onCompact event pollution**: MouseEvent passed to IPC → structured clone failure; wrapped with `() => compactAgent()`
- **Extension RPC lifecycle**:
  - Extension commands now cleared after session output (not before)
  - Non-dialog UI requests rendered as cards, no popup
  - Extension UI request lifecycle: pending cleared on agent_end
- **Message rendering**:
  - TurnRow renders by `run.items` original chronological order, restoring interleaved thinking/tool/answer display
  - `showThinking` dynamically read from pi agent config, takes effect on agent switch
  - Fragmented `content[].text` blocks from Anthropic-compatible providers are concatenated without synthetic newlines, fixing vertical-looking assistant replies
  - `<button>` nesting fixed: ExtensionWidgetCard close uses `<span role=button>`
- **Worktree**: refined project handling, session loading under worktree projects fixed
- **Share & widget UI**: visual polish and layout correction
- **Prompt frontmatter**: `description` no longer duplicated into message body
- **Translated built-in prompt descriptions**: auto-switch between zh-CN/en-US based on app language

### 🛠 Refactor

- Split non-component exports from `AppParts.tsx` into `AppUtils.ts` (fixes Vite Fast Refresh warning)
- RPC extension command idle check clarified

## v0.6.4 - 2026-07-05

### 🚀 New Features

  switching between Plan Mode and Normal Mode. In Plan Mode the agent first
  generates a plan, executes step by step with confirmation, and returns to
  the menu on cancel.

  selection mapping, entry migration, right-aligned animation, and theme-aware
  semantic color tokens.
- **pi-deck-todo Built-in Extension**: New todo list extension for task
  management; widget rendering by widget key (no flatMap merging), with
  truncation and scrolling for long text.
- **Content Width Restriction**: New draggable content width slider (default
  unlimited, drag left to narrow, minimum 800 px).
- **Thinking Block Rework & Status Indicator**:
  - Thinking rendered as ThinkingBlock cards, AssistantText reverted to plain text
  - Thinking blocks rendered in-place by `<thinking>` tags, preserving original
    alternating order in content array (no merging or repositioning)
  - ThinkingBlock default expanded after streaming; manually collapsible
  - ThinkingBlock trigger with content preview subtitle, font matching tool-card
  - Toolbar "running" dot replaced by three-dot animated indicator at message
    list bottom: supports "Thinking", "Executing {tool}", and waiting states;
    auto-hides when model starts responding

  untrusted projects can still be opened; projects with running agents cannot
  be deleted.
- **DiagnosticMessageCard**: New error/system message card with tone-coded styling.
- **Settings Page Enhancements**:
  - defaultProvider/defaultModel dropdowns with cascading and auto-discovery
  - enabledModels multi-select UI with model favorites pinned to top
  - Use lucide Star icon instead of Unicode ★

  - Empty session outline grayed with persistent hover state
- **Feishu Bridge Enhancements**:
  - Optimized model switch card, fixed rich table rendering
  - Fixed file send false triggers and duplicate sends
  - Streamlined Feishu bridge code

### ✨ UI Polish

- **Thinking Card Breathing Animation**: Streaming thinking card now has pulsing
  border glow and subtle background pulse, so you can tell the system is still
  active even when text stalls.
- **Thinking Card Background**: Matches the tool-running card style with a subtle
  accent-tinted background.
- **Web Search Card Subtitle**: Collapsed `web_search` / `fetch_content` tool cards
  now show the search query or URL as a subtitle.
- **Content Width Slider**: Minimum value raised from 50 to 800 px to prevent
  overly narrow composition area.
- **Waiting Indicator Spacing**: Three-dot indicator now has 16 px margin above.
- **Composer Optimization**: Default height reduced by 25 px, forced reset after
  sending; composer moved down 10 px for more bottom breathing room.
- **Terminal Toggle Animation**: Changed to smooth slide-in from below the input
  area instead of a jarring pop.
- **Right Drawer Animation**: Grid layout transition animation improved, reverted
  to 0.18s ease version for fluidity.

  layout; file list collapsed by default.
- **Chat Area Background**: Unified to `#fcfcfc` in light mode, `#fbfaf7` in warm mode.
- **Tool Card Fixes**: JSON string parameter parsing, removed elapsed-time threshold,
  summary moved after timestamp; restored tool-call elapsed time display.
- **Slash Command Labels** now in Chinese, matching the dropdown display.
- **Branch-dropdown** centered positioning + unified New Agent background color.
- **ConfigModal**: User-Agent field layout fix, compat options description added.
- **Compatibility Settings**: Explicitly writes `false` when unchecked, simplified desc.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Dark Mode White Backgrounds**: Fixed hardcoded `#fcfcfc` in `.chat-pane`,
  `.composer`, `.composer-box`, and loading overlay — now properly adapts to
  dark mode via `--color-bg-panel`.
- **RichInput Newline Fix**: Fixed multi-line paste newline loss in contentEditable.
- **Message Rendering Fixes**:
  - Increased global message spacing specificity to override component margins
  - Removed `.thinking-card.streaming` margin-top:0, restored global 16px spacing
  - extension-widget-stack and composer-footer now respect content width limit
  - AssistantText supports message.thinking fallback rendering
  - Thinking/tool rendered in chronological order; fixed auto-scroll and cache hit rate
- **Plan Mode Fixes**: Cross-session deadlock, inability to exit within session,
  slash command breakage; cancel returns to menu; dialog options improved.

- System tray behavior is more reliable.

## v0.5.0 - 2026-06-14

### Added
- LAN web service: Settings can now start a local HTTP service so devices on the same network can open PiDeck through the host machine's IP and configured port.
- pi Extension management: the configuration modal now includes extension management alongside Models, Auth, Settings, Raw config, and Skills.
- Git branch creation: the branch selector can create a new branch from the current branch without leaving PiDeck.
- Project context action: project rows can be revealed directly in the system file manager.
- VitePress documentation site and a full UI design audit, documenting the current desktop workbench architecture and design-system direction.

### Improved
- Major desktop shell refresh: the project sidebar, chat workspace, drawer, composer, splitters, context menus, and modal surfaces now use a shared semantic token system for typography, color, spacing, radius, focus, and motion.
- Dark mode coverage is now much broader across the workspace, Settings, Config, Feedback, RPC logs, Codex import, image preview, message stream, tool calls, terminal dock, and confirmation dialogs.
- Full-screen Settings, Config, and Feedback pages now fit the custom Electron titlebar better and avoid overlapping the PiDeck titlebar/brand area.
- Sidebar workflows are clearer: recent project sessions are shown inline, left-click opens or reuses the session, right-click is reserved for management actions, and the agent-row close button was removed to reduce misclicks.
- Session and agent context menus now focus on management actions; historical sessions can be renamed, copied, exported, inspected through RPC logs, or deleted from the sidebar menu.
- Settings dropdowns now use a custom PiDeck-styled select component instead of native browser select popups.
- Header actions are grouped by branch context, session actions, and panel toggles; the model/status chips have more breathing room and no longer feel clipped by the header divider.
- Shared UI primitives now cover buttons, icon buttons, close buttons, text fields, and select fields, reducing visual drift across Settings, Config, Feedback, updates, environment checks, and import dialogs.
- PiDeck branding, fonts, logo treatment, image preview overlays, picker palettes, and terminal typography have been refined for a more consistent desktop feel.
- Localization coverage is much broader across workspace flows, configuration, settings, window controls, feedback, update prompts, RPC logs, model/thinking pickers, and low-frequency toasts.
- Terminal Pi Soft now adapts to dark mode with a dedicated xterm palette.

### Fixed
- Composer arrow keys no longer accidentally trigger history navigation while editing text.
- Windows pi shim startup keeps the expected Node runtime alignment.
- Configuration modal crash boundaries and white-screen recovery were improved for unsupported or complex config shapes.

## v0.4.17 - 2026-06-11

### Added
- Global Skill management: the configuration modal now has a standalone Skills page for listing skills from `~/.pi/agent/skills` and `~/.agents/skills`.
- Skill actions: create a Skill template, enable or disable model invocation, delete a Skill with an in-app confirmation dialog, and open Skill folders from the desktop UI.
- Manual pi path fallback: users can enter a custom pi path when automatic detection fails, and the Settings page now shows the active pi path inline.

### Fixed
- Windows pi command validation now supports `.cmd` shim paths containing spaces by preserving the hand-built `cmd.exe /c` command line.
- Manual pi path validation now normalizes quoted paths, doubled backslashes, and extension-less paths before saving the usable command.
- Windows detection no longer relies on PowerShell `pi.ps1` shims, reducing quoting and execution-policy failures.

### Improved
- Skill rows now use the same compact card style as the session history list.
- pi environment detection failures now show inline details in Settings, while startup detection still uses the environment dialog.

## v0.4.16 - 2026-06-11

### Added
- Anonymous usage statistics: packaged builds now send at most one `app_heartbeat` per day to understand version distribution, platform compatibility, and active installations.
- Privacy control: Settings now includes an opt-out switch for anonymous usage statistics.

### Improved
- Privacy documentation now explains what the heartbeat collects, what it does not collect, and that the third-party analytics service receives request metadata.
- Telemetry coverage now includes tests for opt-out, unpackaged builds, missing project keys, daily throttling, and PostHog person property sync.

## v0.4.15 - 2026-06-09

### Added
- Built-in Chat workspace: a fixed Chat entry now appears at the top of the project list for general conversations that do not need a code project.
- Project drag sorting: regular project rows can now be reordered by drag and drop, with the custom order persisted across restarts.

### Fixed
- Terminal scrollback restore: switching away from an agent and back now restores terminal output and scrollbar state.
- Agent startup focus: a newly created agent no longer steals focus if you switch to another agent while it is still starting.
- Composer drafts: each agent now keeps its own unsent text and image attachments instead of sharing one global composer draft.
- Provider connection tests now use smaller probe requests and clearer timeout guidance, reducing false failures with slow reasoning models or queued upstream providers.

### Improved
- Refreshed the app icon, boot logo, and built-in Chat entry with the new `#14b814` brand green while keeping regular project avatars more neutral.

## v0.4.14 - 2026-06-09

### Improved
- Release package size: build-time and renderer-only libraries are no longer listed as production dependencies, reducing the packaged app payload and download size across Windows, macOS, and Linux releases.

## v0.4.13 - 2026-06-09

### Fixed
- Windows pi path handling: install checks and RPC agent startup now handle npm shim paths that contain spaces.
- Long assistant answers now stay within the conversation area, including historical sessions, thinking blocks, code blocks, and tables.

## v0.4.12 - 2026-06-09

### Added
- Running-session prompt delivery modes: while an agent is streaming, messages can now be sent as `steer` to affect the next LLM call or as `followUp` to queue until the agent stops.
- Delivery badges on user messages now show whether a running-session message will apply before the next call or after the current run finishes.

### Improved
- Short user messages now shrink to their actual content width even when delivery badges are visible.

## v0.4.11 - 2026-06-08

### Added
- Project history quick action: each project row now includes a dedicated history button, so historical sessions can be opened without relying on the context menu.
- Per-answer file-change summary: each completed agent answer now shows a compact list of modified file names and changed line counts directly below that answer, while the Files panel keeps the session-wide overview.
- In-app update check: PiDeck now periodically checks the latest GitHub Release and shows release notes plus browser download links when a newer version is available.
- Update failure guidance: manual update checks now explain GitHub connectivity issues, suggest configuring the desktop proxy, and provide a direct Release-page fallback.

### Fixed
- Agent terminal isolation: switching projects or agents no longer reuses another agent's open terminal state.
- Terminal initialization: opening the terminal no longer creates duplicate tabs automatically in development/runtime race conditions.
- macOS app icon packaging: release builds now generate a real `.icns` file instead of a mislabeled PNG, improving Dock icon rendering.
- Composer wrapping and resizing: the prompt input now wraps and scrolls more reliably for long content, can be shrunk again after being dragged to maximum height, and the window no longer shrinks below the layout's safe range.
- Update-check toast cleanup: manual update result hints now disappear automatically instead of staying pinned at the bottom of the window.
- Project history refresh feedback: the history modal now shows loading feedback when refreshing sessions.

### Improved
- Model defaults: newly added models now start with `contextWindow=1000000`, `maxTokens=128000`, and reasoning enabled by default.

## v0.4.10 - 2026-06-08

### Added
- Project history quick action: each project row now includes a dedicated history button, so historical sessions can be opened without relying on the context menu.

### Fixed
- Agent terminal isolation: switching projects or agents no longer reuses another agent's open terminal state.
- Terminal initialization: opening the terminal no longer creates duplicate tabs automatically in development/runtime race conditions.
- macOS app icon packaging: release builds now generate a real `.icns` file instead of a mislabeled PNG, improving Dock icon rendering.
- Composer wrapping: the prompt input now wraps and scrolls more reliably for long content, and the window no longer shrinks below the layout's safe range.

### Improved
- Model defaults: newly added models now start with `contextWindow=1000000`, `maxTokens=128000`, and reasoning enabled by default.

## v0.4.9 - 2026-06-08

### Added
- Project history modal: open historical sessions from the project context menu and rename sessions with an inline action.
- Terminal selection copy: right-click selected terminal text to copy it, with a lightweight confirmation hint.

### Fixed
- Codex-imported sessions now include compatible assistant usage metadata, preventing `totalTokens` errors when continuing imported conversations.

### Improved
- Codex session import now starts with no sessions selected by default, avoiding accidental bulk overwrite/import.
- Historical session rows now use a compact Codex-style list layout with lighter rename controls.

## v0.4.8 - 2026-06-07

### Added
- pi agent proxy settings: inject proxy environment variables into newly started pi agent processes, with an OpenAI API connectivity check.
- Desktop proxy settings: route model discovery and provider connection tests through Electron's desktop network proxy.

### Improved
- Reorganized the settings modal into Basic Settings, Proxy Settings, and Developer Settings tabs with clearer save feedback.
- New providers no longer write a default User-Agent header; leaving the field empty preserves the pi / SDK runtime default.

## v0.4.7 - 2026-06-07

### Added
- Embedded terminal dock: open an agent-scoped terminal between the chat timeline and composer without leaving the session.
- Terminal tabs: create, switch, close individual tabs, or close all tabs with an in-app confirmation.
- Terminal themes: switch between Pi Soft, Solarized Light, Solarized Dark, One Dark, and Monokai.

### Improved
- Refactored the large config modal into focused tabs and shared helpers, making provider, auth, settings, and raw JSON editing easier to maintain.
- Split the main renderer display components out of `App.tsx`, reducing the main UI entry point and preparing the app for future panel work.
- Windows packaging now uses the `node-pty` prebuilds instead of forcing a native rebuild, avoiding Visual Studio Spectre library requirements during `electron-builder`.

## v0.4.6 - 2026-06-07

### Added
- Provider model discovery: fetch available models directly from configured provider endpoints.
- Provider connection test: send a minimal request to verify Base URL, API key, model ID, custom headers, latency, and token usage before starting an agent.
- Provider management improvements: rename providers in the Models tab and configure request headers/User-Agent visually.

### Improved
- API type compatibility: removed the non-pi `openai-chat-completions` preset, migrate the legacy alias to `openai-completions`, and align provider tests with pi's official Chat Completions provider name.
- Slash command and file suggestions now support keyboard selection for a smoother composer workflow.
- Added OpenAI Responses compatibility handling, including SDK-like User-Agent fallback for providers that validate client headers.
- Updated config preview mocks and IPC contracts for the new provider model fetch and testing flows.

## v0.4.5 - 2026-06-05

### Added
- Config export/import: package models.json, auth.json, and settings.json
  into a single JSON file for backup and migration.
- Provider compat settings: visual editor for supportsDeveloperRole and
  supportsReasoningEffort options, no manual JSON editing required.
- Image preview in composer: click thumbnail images to view full-size
  preview in modal.
- Modified files list in file drawer: shows files changed by the current
  session's agent at the top of the file drawer.
- Right-click context menu on modified files: open file, reveal in folder,
  or reference in composer.
- Session duration display: total elapsed time shown in the status bar
  after session ends (e.g., 3.2s / 1m23s).
- Reload/Restart button loading state: buttons show loading text and
  become disabled during agent restart.

### Fixed
- Error detection logic: prevented normal tool outputs (e.g., "Successfully
  replaced") from being displayed as error messages.
- Image preview area overlapping with textarea: adjusted grid layout so
  image preview occupies its own row.
- Agent error handling: error messages are now written into the session
  when agent ends abnormally (API errors, etc.), preventing blank responses.
- agent_end error extraction: iterates through messages array to find
  error messages instead of relying on fixed position.
- Modified files list readability: increased font size and color contrast.
- Git branch selector: now shows only local branches, removed remote
  branches from dropdown.

### Improved
- Config modal UI: width increased to 900px, export/import buttons
  match save button style, provider expand area has more spacing,
  delete button icons unified.
- Close button color darkened for better visibility.
- Removed Reload button: `/reload` cannot be correctly executed via RPC
  prompt, unified to use Restart button for all reload scenarios.

## v0.4.4 - 2026-06-05

### Added
- Input history navigation: press Up/Down arrow in the composer to cycle
  through previously sent messages (CLI-like workflow).
- Edit button on user messages: click to copy the text back into the composer
  for editing and re-sending.
- API type dropdown in Models tab: preset options (openai-completions,
  openai-chat-completions, openai-responses, anthropic, google-generative-ai)
  with custom value fallback for unknown types.

### Improved
- Config modal UI overhaul: softer card styling, blurred input styles,
  consistent borders, model list panel layout, and refined spacing across
  Models/Auth expanded sections.
- Agent startup no longer blocks switching to other agents: replaced global
  `agentLoading` overlay with per-agent `status === "starting"` check.
- Saving config no longer auto-reloads the active agent; use the Restart
  button for manual reload instead.
- Model switch and thinking level toggle are now disabled while the agent
  is actively responding (prevents mid-stream config changes).
- Tool call group status now correctly reflects completion: checks the last
  tool message status instead of any message, so groups no longer show
  "in progress" after all tools finish.
- Thinking bubble rendering position restored to the bottom of the message
  list for natural chronological stacking during streaming.

## v0.4.3 - 2026-06-04

### Added
- Real-time thinking process display: shows model reasoning during streaming
  with collapsible content block, so users know the model is working instead of
  appearing stuck. Thinking content is persisted in messages for both current
  and historical sessions.
- RPC log panel: accessible via right-click context menu on agent tabs, shows
  detailed request/response/event flow with expandable JSON data view.
- DevTools toggle button in Settings for easier debugging.

### Improved
- Settings modal width increased from 420px to 640px for better readability.
- ANSI escape codes stripped from thinking content (terminal color sequences
  like `\x1b[38;2;...m` are now cleaned).

## v0.4.2 - 2026-06-04

### Added
- Message queuing when agent is busy: sending while agent is running
  automatically queues messages locally, flushed with steer semantics
  when agent becomes idle (aligned with pi CLI behavior).
- Cancel button on queued message bubbles to remove pending items.
- Queue UI: semi-transparent dashed bubble, spinning indicator,
  "Queue Send" button with pulse animation.

### Improved
- Queued messages isolated by agentId when switching agents,
  preventing cross-agent message delivery.
- Failed sends fall back to queue with toast notification instead of
  permanent loss.
- Restart now auto-resolves sessionPath and retries loadMessages
  on failure for better history restoration.

### Fixed
- Flush not triggering after agent completes (now pushes runtimeState
  with isStreaming reset on agent_end).
- Blank screen after agent restart when history session fails to load.
- get_commands timeout errors polluting console on startup.

## v0.4.1 - 2026-06-03

### Improved
- User messages now display as plain text instead of Markdown, preventing special characters from being misinterpreted.
- Notifications are now only sent when the session ends, not during tool calls.
- Thinking bubble animation continues to display during tool execution.
- Hidden the collapse/expand arrow icon in the project list for a cleaner look.
- Reduced left-side whitespace in the project list for a more compact layout.
- Adjusted the close button position on agent rows to avoid overlapping with the border.

## v0.4.0 - 2026-06-02

### Added
- Image support: paste images from clipboard (Ctrl+V) or drag and drop into chat composer.
- Image preview in user messages with click-to-zoom fullscreen viewer.
- History session image restoration: images from previous sessions now display correctly when reopening.
- Session end notification: system notification when agent finishes responding (configurable in settings).
- Large image auto-compression: images are resized to 2000px max edge to reduce context usage.
- Error feedback when sending images to unsupported models.

### Improved
- Optimized image transmission by auto-converting PNG/WebP to JPEG for smaller payload size.
- Send button now enabled for image-only messages without text.
- History session loading now extracts and displays images from pi session files.

### Fixed
- Fixed history sessions showing thinking/reasoning content instead of actual responses.
- Fixed image sending failure with no error feedback (now shows error in chat).
- Fixed ANSI escape codes appearing in message summaries.

## v0.3.0 - 2026-06-02

### Added
- Configuration management modal: click the sliders icon in the sidebar to view and edit pi's global config files (`models.json`, `auth.json`, `settings.json`).
- Models tab: visual editor with provider cards, model list in grid layout, add/delete providers and models, inline editing for id, name, contextWindow, maxTokens, reasoning.
- Auth tab: view and edit API keys per provider, add/delete auth entries, show/hide toggle and copy-to-clipboard for keys.
- Settings tab: key-value editor with type-aware inputs (boolean checkboxes, number fields, JSON for complex values).
- Raw tab: direct JSON editor for each config file with file selector switcher.
- Auto-reload after saving config changes (triggers `agents.reload` on the active agent).
- `!command` and `!!command` bash execution in the chat composer, matching pi terminal behavior: `!` runs and sends output to LLM, `!!` runs silently.
- Git branch selector now fetches both local and remote branches, with branch count badge and empty-state hint.

### Improved
- Replaced all emoji icons with lucide-react professional icons (Search, ChevronLeft/Right/Down, Play, Check, GitBranch, Eye/EyeOff, Trash2, Settings, Sliders).
- Sidebar icons (config management + settings) use distinct lucide-react icons with hover highlight.
- Auth and provider form layouts use horizontal label+input grid for better alignment.
- API key inputs support show/hide toggle and one-click copy across both Models and Auth tabs.
- Branch dropdown z-index and overflow fixes for reliable display inside the chat header.

### Fixed
- Fixed Reload button in chat header: was sending `/reload` as a prompt message instead of calling the dedicated `agents.reload` IPC handler.
- Fixed source file tab in config modal: switching files now reloads the correct content instead of always showing `settings.json`.
- Fixed git branch dropdown being empty due to `overflow: hidden` on parent containers clipping the dropdown.
- Fixed stray tab character in BranchSelector JSX that could cause rendering issues.

## v0.2.2 - 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- Fixed tray icon not showing in packaged apps by using electron-vite's `?asset` suffix for correct path resolution.
- Fixed settings modal overflowing viewport on smaller screens by adding max-height constraint and scrollable content area.

## v0.2.1 - 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- Stripped ANSI terminal escape codes from pi output in chat messages, tool details, and conversation outline.
- Conversation outline now shows last 15 items by default with a "show all" button to expand the full list; panel is scrollable with max-height 70vh.
- Increased outline summary truncation from 34 to 48 characters for better readability.

## v0.2.0 - 2026-06-01

### Added
- Session rename: right-click a session card in the history drawer to rename inline (Enter confirms, Esc cancels). Persists via sessionName metadata in the JSONL file.
- Built-in slash command suggestions: type `/` to see 12 pi built-in commands (session, tree, clone, compact, copy, export, share, settings, reload, hotkeys, login, logout) alongside extension-registered commands.

### Improved
- Filtered redundant built-in commands (/new, /model, /resume, /fork) that already have dedicated desktop UI.
- Removed /name command in favor of the new session rename UI.

## v0.1.9 - 2026-06-01

### Added
- System tray support: closing the window now hides to the system tray by default; added a "close to tray" toggle in settings.
- Tray context menu with "Show Window" and "Exit" actions; double-click tray icon to restore (Windows).
- Restart button for agents: stops the pi RPC process and re-spawns with the same session, picking up new provider/API key configuration changes that `/reload` cannot apply.
- Manual context compaction button in the composer toolbar, visible when context usage exceeds 30%; shows live percentage and loading state.
- Custom branch dropdown replacing the native `<select>`, with hover highlights, active branch indicator, and open/close animation.

### Improved
- Refined chat header layout: tighter spacing, gradient "New Session" button, polished action group styling with transitions.
- Branch selector, session actions, and composer are hidden during agent loading to avoid showing stale UI.
- History drawer closes immediately when clicking a session instead of waiting for agent creation to finish.
- Switched to official pi wordmark logo from pi.dev for app icon, sidebar, agent avatars, boot screen, and empty state.
- Context compaction button uses yellow highlight during compaction and is disabled while streaming.

## v0.1.8 - 2026-06-01

### Improved
- Chat links now open in the system default browser instead of navigating inside the Electron window.
- All projects show their agent lists by default when switching projects; added per-project collapse/expand toggle.

## v0.1.7 - 2026-06-01

### Improved
- Reduced the default project list width to leave more room for the conversation area.
- Refined the project search bar and add button layout so the add button stays visible when the window is narrowed.

## v0.1.6 - 2026-06-01

### Improved
- Improved Markdown table rendering in chat messages with clearer borders, spacing, header styling, and safe horizontal scrolling for wide tables.
- Replaced the hard-to-discover native textarea resize handle with a visible top-edge composer resize grip.
- Composer resizing now keeps bounded heights so expanding the input area does not take over the conversation timeline.

## v0.1.5 - 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- Refined the chat header layout so long project paths and session controls fit more reliably in narrow windows.

## v0.1.4 - 2026-05-31

### Added
- Added Stop / abort controls for running agents, backed by pi RPC `abort`.
- Added an assistant waiting animation before the first streamed token arrives.
- Added grouped tool-call cards so one user question no longer floods the timeline with many tool messages.
- Tool-call groups now show a short summary by default and can be expanded for full details.

### Improved
- Tool-call details are collapsed by default and scroll independently when large.
- Running and failed tool calls now have clearer visual states.

## v0.1.3 - 2026-05-31

### Added
- Added startup pi CLI environment checks with a visible status dialog.
- Added a reusable pi command locator for packaged Electron environments.
- Added manual environment checking in Settings.
- Added app version display and a “Check for updates” action that opens GitHub Releases.
- Added a static startup screen to avoid a blank white window while the renderer loads.

### Improved
- Packaged app startup now shows the window only after it is ready to display.
- Project loading is deferred so the main UI can render sooner.
- The pi CLI detector searches common PATH, npm, pnpm, Yarn, Volta, mise, nvm, asdf, bun, deno, and local bin locations.
- Windows `.cmd` pi shims are checked through a shell to avoid false “not installed” results.
- Missing pi CLI guidance now links to the official installation guide.
- Historical sessions started from a parent folder can now appear under the matching child project when the session content references that project.

## v0.1.2 - 2026-05-31

### Fixed
- Fixed project avatars for hidden folders such as `.pi` and `.pi-desktop` by ignoring leading dots and whitespace.
- Added `downloads/` to `.gitignore` so local downloaded artifacts are not included in releases.

### Added
- Added Electron Builder packaging configuration for Windows, macOS, and Linux targets.
- Added packaging scripts for directory builds and platform-specific distribution builds.
